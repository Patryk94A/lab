I will post here all the commands are usefull in my opinion and i might need them in the future

Ifconfig -
su - switch user
passwd userid
ls -ltr -> time creation new -> old
cp -R <source_folder><destination_folder> -> copy folder -R recursive

TO CHECK WHAT IS ON PORT :80
netstat -tulpn | grep :80
ss -tulpn | grep :80
lsof -i :80 | grep LISTEN
